In this activity, you'll build a basic form that allows users to enter their email address.
Upon form submission, the user input should be validated and invalid email
addresses (for simplicity, here email addresses that contain no @ sign are being
referred to here) should lead to an error message being shown below the form. When
invalid email addresses are made valid, potentially visible error messages should be
removed again.
Perform the following steps to complete this activity:

1. Build a user interface that contains a form with a label, an input field (of the text
   typeâ€”to make entering incorrect email addresses easier for demo purposes),
   and a submit button that leads to the form being submitted.Introduction | 131
2. Collect the entered email address and show an error message below the form if
   the email address contains no @ sign.
